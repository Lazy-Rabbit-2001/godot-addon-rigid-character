## A type of [CharacterBody3D] specific to the development of platform games, with some features brought from [RigidBody3D].
##
## A [KineBody3D], or [b]KinematicBody3D[/b] in full, is a specific type for game developers working on platform games, or physics game lovers that want to use 
## a simpler and more easy-to-control edition of [RigidBody3D]. The name "kinematic" represents the way how the body is manipulated by the codes and how you (should) code the bahavior of this body.[br][br]
## 
## A [KineBody3D] contains a lot of properties and methods for easy deployment of a platform game character. You can set its gravity and make the body fall by calling [method move_kinebody].
## Also, you can call [method walking_speed_up], [method walking_slow_down_to_zero], and [method jump] to control the movement of your character.
## For physics lovers, you can also set the [member mass] of the body, and affect the velocity by calling [method apply_momentum] or [method set_momentum].
## Meanwhile, you can call [method accelerate] to apply an acceleration to the body directly, if you prefer pure velocity control.[br][br]
##
## For platform games with multiple gravity directions, setting velocity is a tricky matter, because you have to consider the complicated transformation to the velocity to fit the effect you want to achieve. 
## Fortunately, [KineBody3D] provides a helper member [member motion_vector], which enables you to set the velocity by modifying the value of this member without any consideration of how velocity should be transformed to.
## By default, this handles the velocity to fit the up direction of the body, and you can set the [member motion_vector_direction] to make the velocity transformed by other means. In this way, it is also called [b]local velocity[/b].[br][br]
##
## Although you will be benefic a lot from [KineBody3D], there are still something that you should be careful about.
## Because some calls, like [method jump], [method turn_wall], and [method bounce_jumping_falling], relys on [member CharacterBody3D.up_direction],
## the up direction will keep always being opposite to the gravity. This would bring appearence incoherence: Imagine a character in an
## upside-down gravity space "standing" as if it were in the normal gravity space. Therefore, a new concept "rotation synchronization" is introduced to
## fix this problem. By rotating the body and make the global rotation fit to the up direction, the body will look reasonably.[br][br]
##
## Another thing worth noticing is that, when you call some methods to accelerate the body instance, bear in mind to multiply a [code]delta[/code] time to ensure
## the acceleration is time-independent. Otherwise, the result of acceleration will be incorrect.[br][br]
##
## [b]Note:[/b] During the high consumption of the [method CharacterBody3D.move_kinebody], it is not couraged to run the game with the overnumbered use of [KineBody3D].
